// 8th kyu - Exclusive "or" (xor) Logical Operator

// This function should return an object, but it's not doing what's intended. What's wrong?
//
// Since we cannot define keywords in Javascript (well, at least I don't know how to do it), your task is to define a function xor(a, b) where a and b are the two expressions to be evaluated. Your xor function should have the behaviour described above, returning true if exactly one of the two expressions evaluate to true, false otherwise.
