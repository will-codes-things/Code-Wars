// 8th kyu - Collatz Conjecture (3n+1)
// https://www.codewars.com/kata/577a6e90d48e51c55e000217
//
// The Collatz conjecture (also known as 3n+1 conjecture) is a conjecture that applying the following algorithm to any number we will always eventually reach one:
// 
// [This is writen in pseudocode]
// if(number is even) number = number / 2
// if(number is odd) number = 3*number + 1
// #Task
// 
// Your task is to make a function hotpo that takes a positive n as input and returns the number of times you need to perform this algorithm to get n = 1.
